0) Test it
git clone https://github.com/hapi-server/server-python.git
cd server-python
git switch supermag
python hapi_server.py supermag localhost
(in browser, localhost:8000)

1) Release pass-thru as is (making a ‘hapi’ userid for tracking)
open a port on your machines, alias it, done!

2) Improve network efficiency to #1
	run a parallel supermag.jhuapl.edu server on localhost
	point ‘hapi_server’ to _that_ instead of the external one

3) Shift from pass-thru to  library
	refactor your supermag.jhuapl.edu server code to be either a callable function that returns data, or alt we look at clever socket work instead of https
